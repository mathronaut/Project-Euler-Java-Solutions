***Project Euler solutions written in Java.***

***Purpose of this project*** is creating quality solutions while keeping codes ***simple, adaptive, re-usable and easy for implementation.***

I won't use any ***uncommon or language specific funtion/ibrary***. I'm newbie at coding, so don't expect any expert code trick in my solutions for now, but i'll update the solutions for best as long as i breathe :)

Any participation is greatly appreciated.
