Hi,

This is my Project Euler solutions written in ***Java.***

***Purpose of this project*** is creating quality solutions while keeping codes ***simple, adaptive, re-usable and easy for implementation.***

I won't use any uncommon language specific funtion or library(May be some Math functions and List library etc. if necessary). Just basic algorithms as possible which are almost exists in all programming language.

I'm newbie at coding, so don't expect any expert code trick in my solutions for now, but i'll update the solutions for best as long as i breathe :)

Any participation is greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
