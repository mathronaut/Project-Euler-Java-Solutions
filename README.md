Hi,

My name is Esen, a junior Android Developer who started at 2018 September in result of career change from Mechanical Engineering.

This is my Project Euler solutions written in ***Java.***

Purpose of this project is creating best solutions possible while keeping codes ***simple, re-usable and easy to implementation.***

All you need to do is just execute methods with needed variables in Main.

As i said, i'm newbie at coding, so don't expect any expert code trick in my solutions for now, but i'll update the solutions for best as long as i breathe :)

Any participation is greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
