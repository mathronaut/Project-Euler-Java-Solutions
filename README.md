Hi,

My name is Esen, a junior Android Developer who started at 2018 September.
This is my Project Euler solutions written in Java. As i said, i'm newbie at coding, so don't expect any expert code trick in my solutions for now, but i'll update the solutions for best as long as i breathe :)
Any participation is greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
